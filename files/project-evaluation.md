Here is a basic checklist for a successful project repo:

Have you filled out description and topics to the repo via the GitHub UI?

Is the problem explained clearly?  Do you mention existing work?

Are there text examples or images of actual input and output?

Can the project be reproduced?  Are there instructions for running including the exact parameters, are there links to the exact dataset?
